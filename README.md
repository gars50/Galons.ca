# Problème depuis 2023-12-14 - 09:00
Je voulais juste laisser le monde savoir qu'il y a un problème avec le serveur et que je suis en train de vérifier cela.

# Issue since 2023-12-14 - 09:00
I just wanted to let people know that there is currently a hardware issue and that I am looking into it.

## Timeline
- 2023-12-15 - 12:00
  - Some good news. The new motherboard works with the CPU / GPU. My assumption that the motherboard was bad was correct.
  - Next step will be to check the boot drive and ensure Windows works well with the new motherboard. Then add the RAID back to the machine (All medias / backups) and perform a health check. Then start services again.
  - If everything is green, I'm expecting services to be back around 3pm.
- 2023-12-15 - 11:00
  - Proceeding with the cleaning / install.
- 2023-12-14 - 22:30
  - I have no cleaning material to replace the CPU / Motherboard. Will have to go to the store tomorrow.
- 2023-12-14 - 19:30
  - Going out to buy a used motherboard at 20:00. Will be installing it at 20:30 or so.
- 2023-12-14 - 15:30
  - About 75% sure the motherboard has stopped working correctly. 25% it's the CPU. Have to decide on next actions.

  - Published this website.
- 2023-12-14 - 10:30
  - Might be facing a motherboard / CPU issue. If it is that, replacement could take days.
- 2023-12-14 - 09:00
  - After Windows server updates, the server could not restart by itself.

## Impacted Services
- Plex
- Ombi
- SeenIt
- GalonsBot Discord Bot
- Home Assistant

## Comments
- Data should be safe.
- Medias should still be there once the server boots back up.
